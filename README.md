# Data privacy of the COVID-19 contact tracing app
In these two articles, the first article state some governments actions to protect the data privacy which make the contact tracing app secure, while in the second article, it states that data privacy risk persists in the contact tracing app. 

## Article 1: COVID-19 Contact Tracing: Can it Co-Exist with Personal Privacy? (acts have improve the COVID-19 contact tracing app)

In order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the contacting trace app has been used a lot. To fulfill the folks’ desire of keep personal information private, the government has the CCDPA (COVID-19 Consumer Data Protection Act) and later the PHEPA (The Public Health Emergency Privacy Act ). These two have the legal privacy framework. The CCDPA requires all the covered entities to follow some rules like respect to individuals’ data right. While, at first, the CCDPA may be limited in duration, scope and application, and its protection may be too limited and underfunded, the later PHEPA would have stronger power that could offer great protection.

The PHEPA would prohibit the use of health data for other unrelated area which would better protect the data in the tracing apps. Also, beyond CCDPA, the PHEPA will not preempt the states’ right for stricter legislation. With COVID-19 seriously damage the society, having the contact tracing app would be an effective way to mitigate the spread of it and having acts like PHEPA, people’s privacy right will also be protected well.

## Article 2: Privacy risks persist with DIY COVID-19 contact tracing apps (many issues with data privacy exists)

Although there are some actions of protecting the privacy information for people using contact tracing app, there are some apps become the “Slippery fish” which were created without using API (designed for protecting privacy). The apps with using API, by researcher, could protect the user’s privacy as desired while the DIY apps would be less private that they use GPS and own custom Bluetooth. Many of these DIY apps not only gather the health information but also capture the device information which is undesired, and it could lead to serious privacy information leakage.

There do have some technology that could solve this problem like Name Obfuscation and APIs, but the problem is not all apps follow the instructions. There are some solutions could help with this like asking the apps to implement hook detection and debugger detection. In conclusion, from this article, the contact tracing apps in the market still have great data privacy problem and have not been properly solved.
